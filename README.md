# Pale Pass

[Live Demo](https://nlanky.github.io/pale-pass/)

## Running Locally
### Requirements:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Steps
1. Decide where you want to clone the repository. Open a Node.js command prompt and run `git clone https://github.com/nlanky/pale-pass.git`. If this is the first time you've used GitHub, you'll probably need to authenticate with GitHub.
2. Run `cd pale-pass` in the same command prompt window you cloned the repository.
3. Run `npm install --global yarn` to install the Yarn package manager.
4. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
5. Run `yarn dev`. This should open a browser tab with the app running!
